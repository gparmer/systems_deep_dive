# What do we Mean, a Systems Deep Dive?

A Deep Dive is ["a thorough examination of a subject or topic"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/what-is-a-deep-dive-history-words-were-watching).
I love how computer systems work "under the hood", and this repository and associated [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@nothing6001) are our way to share the wonderful world of systems by doing deep dives into a number of systems topics.



# Who am I

[I'm](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~gparmer/) an academic that refuses to lose sight of systems details.
While I work hard in my day job to provide a strong education in systems at GWU, I want to spread interest in systems topics as wide as I can.
I'm one of the researchers that works on the [Composite OS](https://github.com/gwsystems/composite), so I have a decent understanding of how systems work from the hardware up.
